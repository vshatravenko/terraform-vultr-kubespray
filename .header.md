# Terraform Vultr Kubespray Base Module

This repository contains a Terraform module for [Vultr](vultr.io) that provides a minimal infra base for [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) to provision a Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage


Before starting, be sure to [create a Vultr API key](https://my.vultr.com/settings/#settingsapi) and export it to your shell session:
``` sh
$ export VULTR_API_KEY=*api_key*
```

Also, make sure there is at least one SSH key created on Vultr prior to infra provisioning.

### Listing available resources

If you'd like to see what's on the menu for available regions, instance types, and beyond, look no further:
* [Regions](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-regions):
```sh
curl "https://api.vultr.com/v2/regions" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VULTR_API_KEY}"
```
* [Instance Types](https://www.vultr.com/api/#tag/plans):
```sh
curl "https://api.vultr.com/v2/plans" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VULTR_API_KEY}"
```
* [Operating Systems](https://www.vultr.com/api/#operation/list-os):
```sh
curl "https://api.vultr.com/v2/os" \
  -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VULTR_API_KEY}"
```

### Provisioning

After that, the workflow is pretty simple:
1. Configure `terraform.tfvars` to your heart's content, available variables are described below
2. Fetch Terraform provider plugins and initialize state - `terraform init`
3. Apply the configuration - `terraform apply`


If you'd like to apply a specific change of the IaC without affecting other resources, use targeting:
```sh
$ terraform apply -target *e.g. vultr_instance.masters*
```

### Cluster Setup

After the infra is provisioned, an Ansible inventory file would be rendered and available at `inventory.ini`
This file can be used as is for the kubespray playbook or customized prior to that.

        Pro tip: Make sure to disable the firewall when using iptables-based firewall rules in kubespray

To disable the default firewall(e.g. `ufw`), you can simply run:
```sh
$ ansible -i inventory.ini -m command -a "ufw disable" -u root all
```

Then, you can copy `inventory.ini` to an existing Ansible workspace, or create a new one by copying the [sample inventory]():
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray -b v2.23.1
$ cp -R kubespray/inventory/sample *ansible_workspace_path*/inventory
$ cp inventory.ini *ansible_workspace_path*/inventory
```

Finally, after setting all the desired values in Kubespray config files, initiate the cluster setup:
```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i *ansible_workspace_path*/inventory.ini --user=root --become --become-user=root cluster.yml -v
```

To connect to the cluster, simply SSH to any master node, copy `/etc/kubernets/admin.conf` to your machine, and run `kubectl get nodes`
